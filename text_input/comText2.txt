properties of computational and intractable problems), are highly abstract, while fields such as computer graphics emphasize real world visual applications. Still other 
fields focus on challenges in implementing computation. For example, programming language theory considers various approaches to the description of computation, 
while the study of computer programming itself investigates various aspects of the use of programming language and complex systems. Human computer interaction 
considers the challenges in making computers and computations useful, usable, and universally accessible to humans.
The earliest foundations of what would become computer science predate the invention of the modern digital computer. Machines for calculating fixed numerical tasks 
such as the abacus have existed since antiquity, aiding in computations such as multiplication and division. Further, algorithms for performing computations have existed 
since antiquity, even before the development of sophisticated computing equipment. The ancient Sanskrit treatise Shulba Sutras, or "Rules of the Chord", is a book of 
algorithms written in 800 BC for constructing geometric objects like altars using a peg and chord, an early precursor of the modern field of computational geometry.
